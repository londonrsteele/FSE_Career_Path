# Portfolio Project: JavaScript Syntax > Mixed Messages
## What is a Portfolio Project?
This project is a little different from other Codecademy projects you've
encountered. In this project, you will bring together what you have learned in
previous elssons to buildd a project in your own development environment and 
publish it to the web!

### How do Portfolio Projects Work?
We'll provide you with high-level tasks to guide your project to completion, 
but you will be responsible for deciding how to implement them in your code.

There are many possibel ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and
you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you
encountere a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Note that there are hints that can assist you, but they will only provide one
potential implementation. Do not worry if your program looks different from ours!

## Project Prompt: Mixed Messages
In this project, you'll build a message generator program that outputs a new,
random messgae every time a user runs the program. Your program should 
showcase basic JavaScript syntax and programming concepts.

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user
runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take
the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, 
inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random,
the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different 
pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the 
program and customize it to your liking.

### My design
I will make a joke generator!
