# Javascript Syntax Part I > Learn JavaScript Syntax: Conditionals > Magic 8 Ball
## Project Description
Build a virtual Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript. You’ll 
practice building decision-making into your programs and gain confidence in 
writing more robust JavaScript code.

You’ve learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! It’s so powerful, in
fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.

In this project we will build a 
[Magic Eight Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) using control 
flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random
fortune.
