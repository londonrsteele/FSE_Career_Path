# Portfolio Project: Personal Portfolio Project > Personal Portfolio Project
## What is a Portfolio Project?
This project is a little different from other Codecademy projects you've
encountered. In this project, you will bring together what you have learned in
previous elssons to buildd a project in your own development environment and 
publish it to the web!

### How do Portfolio Projects Work?
We'll provide you with high-level tasks to guide your project to completion, 
but you will be responsible for deciding how to implement them in your code.

There are many possibel ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and
you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you
encountere a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Note that there are hints that can assist you, but they will only provide one
potential implementation. Do not worry if your program looks different from ours!

## Project Prompt: Personal Portfolio Project
Portfolio websites are key to your career in web development–they let you show 
off all the awesome projects that you’ve made and provide a way for people to 
get in touch with you. This project will give you an overview of how to make one
for yourself.

## Overview
### **Portfolio Website**
For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website 
where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a 
portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that 
you’ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone 
wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each 
project, detailing the technology used.
