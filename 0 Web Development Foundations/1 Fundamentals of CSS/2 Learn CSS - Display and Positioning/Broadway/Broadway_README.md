# Fundamentals of CSS > Learn CSS : Display & Positioning > Broadway
## Project Description
In this project, we’re going to practice element positioning in CSS so you can
hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. Why? 
Applying the display and position properties on a certain element is something 
you’ll be doing plenty of with CSS, so exploring and practicing it now will help
you a lot.
In this project, you will use properties such as `display` and `position` to 
improve the layout of the landing page for a fictional design firm, Broadway 
Design.
The site has some style rules to begin with. You will improve the layout and 
positioning of the navigation menu at the top of the page and the three 
supporting sections (Design, Develop, Deploy) below the image.
