# FSE_Career_Path
A repo for the projects in Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Career Path

## Course: Fundamentals of HTML
### Section: Learn HTML: Structure
#### Project: Fashion Blog
Your friend Isa is a budding fashion blogger, and she’s asked you to build her 
a new website, just in time for New York Fashion Week!
Use your new HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the blog. 
Make sure to include plenty of pictures, links, lists, and other HTML elements 
that you’ve learned so that her fans have plenty to read.

### Section: Learn HTML: Tables
#### Project: Wine Festival Schedule
The Aguillar Family is hosting their annual wine festival and they have asked 
you to build a web page for the event schedule! Use your knowledge of HTML to 
display a table to the attendees.

### Section: Semantic HTML
#### Project: NYC Blog
Create a blog about New York City using various semantic elements to show off 
how amazing the Big Apple is!  
After researching New York City, you decide to create a blog for your viewers 
who want to know more about the city. It’s time to create a blog to show off 
how amazing the Big Apple is. You got this!

## Course: Fundamentals of CSS
### Section: Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules
#### Project: Healthy Recipes
Using CSS selectors, you’ll give a recipe website style.

#### Project: Olivia Woodruff Portfolio
In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of CSS visual rules to create rule 
sets and improve the appearance of a photography portfolio site!

### Section: Learn CSS: The Box Model
#### Project: Davie's Burgers
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional
restaurant’s website. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, but the 
box model properties have yet to be set. You’ll use knowledge of `height`, 
`width`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin` to complete this project.

### Section: Learn CSS: Display and Positioning
#### Project: Broadway
In this project, we’re going to practice element positioning in CSS so you can
hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. Why? 
Applying the display and position properties on a certain element is something 
you’ll be doing plenty of with CSS, so exploring and practicing it now will help
you a lot.
In this project, you will use properties such as `display` and `position` to 
improve the layout of the landing page for a fictional design firm, Broadway 
Design.
The site has some style rules to begin with. You will improve the layout and 
positioning of the navigation menu at the top of the page and the three 
supporting sections (Design, Develop, Deploy) below the image.


## Course: Improved Styling with CSS
## Section: Challenge Project
### Project: Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on
Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series 
of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There 
are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you 
should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you 
encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.
In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you 
build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML
& CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes 
and projects.

## Section: Learn Links and Buttons
### Project: The Summit
Time to put some navigation design knowledge to the test! Your goal is to 
improve the user experience of this ski lodge landing page. Currently, none of
the clickable elements are very clear or offer good visual feedback to users.

The exact implementation and styling will be up to you; take the opportunity 
to be creative in your designs! Keep in mind that slick styling is cool, but 
it is just as important to clearly demonstrate to users how to interact with 
the site. We’ll provide some hints along the way if you’re stuck.
