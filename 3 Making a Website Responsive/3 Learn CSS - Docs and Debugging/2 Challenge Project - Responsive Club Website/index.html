      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of Baylor's Chapter of Pi Epsilon the National Environmental Sciences Honor
        Society is to reward academic excellence in undergraduate and graduate students as 
        well as provide opportunities for members to promote academic excellence. To be 
        eligible as a regular member of the Society, students must be enrolled in an 
        interdisciplinary environmental science program at an accredited institution where a
        chapter of Pi Epsilon is established. If the institution does not offer an 
        interdisciplinary environmental science program, students must be enrolled in a natural
        science program at an accredited institution where a chapter of Pi Epsilon is 
        established.
