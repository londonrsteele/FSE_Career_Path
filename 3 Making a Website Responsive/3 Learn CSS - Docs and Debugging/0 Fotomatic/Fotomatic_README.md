# Making a Website Responsive > Learn CSS: Documentation and Debugging > Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic
## Project Description
In this project, you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called 
Fotomatic. You will be provided with specs to help guide you in making 
adjustments to the broken code. To get started, download the 
[broken code](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/full-stack-career-journey/Fotomatic/fotomatic_broken.zip) and the 
[design specs](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/full-stack-career-journey/Fotomatic/fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png)! 
You can also see a working version of the 
[final product](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/full-stack-career-journey/Fotomatic/final/index.html).

As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the 
Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome
DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style 
values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.
