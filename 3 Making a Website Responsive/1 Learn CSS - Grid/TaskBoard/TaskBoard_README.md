# Making a Website Responsive > Learn CSS - Grid > Task Board
## Project Description
In this project, you will create a board of to-do items organized into columns.
All of the HTML and most of the CSS have been written for you, but the grid 
property declarations have yet to be added.

In order to complete this project, you must know how to lay out the structure 
of a gridâ€™s rows and columns and place items within that grid using CSS.

The premade index.html and style.css files are displayed for you. Click this
