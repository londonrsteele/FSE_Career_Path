# Fundamentals of CSS > Improved Styling with CSS > Challenge Project: Build Your Own Website Design System
## Project Description
### **Overview**
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on
Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series
of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There
are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you 
should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you 
encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

### **Project Goals**
In this project, you’ll be building your own basic design system for a website. 
In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the
future! On your site, you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the 
repeating styles.

### **Project Requirements**
In this project, you’ll build a style guide/design system for your website. 
Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and 
feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the 
visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles
will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you 
start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference 
for how your website should be built.

Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, 
fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas
as you’d like. You can take a look at our basic example site for a taste of 
what you’ll be building (yours will be customized).
