# Fundamentals of CSS > Improved Styling with CSS > Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
## Project Description
### **Overview**
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on
Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series 
of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There 
are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you 
should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you 
encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

### **Project Goals**
In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you 
build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML
 & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes 
 and projects.
