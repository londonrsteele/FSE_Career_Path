# Javascript Syntax Part II > Challenge Project II: Mysterious Organism
## Project Description
### Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on 
Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series 
of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There 
are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you 
should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you 
encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

### Project Goals
Context: You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism
at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism,
Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The
small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents
make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot 
survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and 
expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for 
your research team to study.

As you progress through the steps, use the terminal and console.log() statements
to check the output of your loops and functions.

### Setup Instructions
If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can
download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to
open and work in main.js in a text editor. To edit main.js, use your text editor 
of choice. If you need a recommendation or help to install an editor, we 
recommend looking into our article about setting up a text editor for web 
development (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice: Let’s Make a 
Project”). To run main.js on your computer, you will need to install Node.js. If
you need help installing Node.js, read our article on installing Node.
